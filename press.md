## My work in the press

In my career thus far, I have often had the opportunity to work on projects that are either inherently complex or carry out-sized impact (or sometimes, both). Here's a list of articles by news outles and other media that mentions me or my work. Please note that this is not exhaustive.

- [PayPal](#paypal)
- [Mentoring and judging panels](#mentoring-and-judging-panels)

## [WhatsApp](#whatsapp)

_2021 - current_

At Meta, I work on WhatsApp, which has a far-reaching impact - 3 billion users (yes, billion) across the globe.

## [PayPal](#paypal)

At PayPal, I worked on enabling solutions for its most stretegic partnerships. When I wasn't doing that, I was working on the cutting-edge of blockchain and cryptocurreny in its Innovation Lab.

## [Mentoring and judging panels](#mentoring-and-judging-panels)

Over the years, I have built deep and pragmatic expertise in domains like payments, large-scale software and system design, blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I like to find time from my day-to-day to give back to the industry in form of 1:1 or group coaching, peer reviews and feedback or via a panel.
